# Laptop

> Turn any laptop into mine :computer:

Just 'cause I'm tied to manually updating my linux settings between various
computers I decide to program it !  
The goal here is to have one script to rule all my future installation.  
It might be complicate at the beginning to get use to save every meaning full
changes in this repo but it will defiantly make my life easier in the future.  
**My periodic vehicle inspection interval is 1 year**  
(often results in a full system rewrite)

## Installation 

```sh
git clone git@github.com:douglasduteil/laptop.git ~/laptop
```
